# Notes and Working Examples from Test-Driven React

## Chapter 1. Test-Driven Development with Jest
  - *Jest* is a test framework developed by Facebook. Jest runs in a Node.js process.
  - There are several advantages to running tests in a simulated browser environment: *jsdom*
  - It's good practice to declare all new Node projects as `private`
  - `npm` is a package manager, `npx` is a package *runner*
  - `npx` lets you run binaries from local Node packages without adding them to your PATH
  - `describe()` declares a *test suite*, which is a grouping of tests (noun)
  - `it()` declares a *test* (verb)
  - `expect()` creates an *assertion*
  - `toBe()` is a *matcher* that performs a strict equality test between the value being tested and the expected value
